# Cluster API Provider Azure

This repository hosts an implementation of a provider for Azure for the
OpenShift [machine-api](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-api).

This provider runs as a machine-controller deployed by the
[machine-api-operator](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator)

# Upstream Implementation
Other branches of this repository may choose to track the upstream
Kubernetes [Cluster-API Azure provider](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure/)

In the future, we may align the master branch with the upstream project as it
stabilizes within the community.
